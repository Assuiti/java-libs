VACMC=DE_Cardinality/occurrences validity: where occurrences and cardinality are stated, the interval represented by: (sum of all occurrences minimum values) .. (sum of all occurrences maximum values) must intersect with the interval stated by the cardinality.
VCACA=DE_Archetype attribute reference model cardinality conformance: the cardinality of an attribute must conform, i.e. be the same or narrower, to the cardinality of the corresponding attribute in the underlying information model.
VSANCC=DE_Specialised archetype attribute node cardinality conformance: the cardinality of a redefined (multiply-valued) attribute node in a specialised archetype must conform to the cardinality of the corresponding node in the flat parent archetype by either being identical, or being wholly contained by the latter.
VCORM=DE_Object constraint type name validity: a type name introducing an object constraint block must be defined in the underlying information model.
VCORMT=DE_Object constraint type validity: a type name introducing an object constraint block must be the same as or conform to the type stated in the underlying information model of its owning attribute.
VSONCT=DE_Specialised archetype object node type conformance: the reference model type of a redefined object node in a specialised archetype must conform to the reference model type in the corresponding node in the flat parent archetype by either being identical, or conforming via an inheritance relationship in the relevant reference model.
VSONIR=DE_Specialised archetype object node redefinition: if defined, the node identifier of a redefined object node in a specialised archetype must be redefined into its specialised form if any other aspect of the immediate object constraint is redefined.
VSONCI=DE_Specialised archetype object node identifier conformance: if defined, the node identifier of a redefined object node in a specialised archetype must conform to the node identifier in the corresponding node in the flat parent archetype by either being identical, or being a derived identifier at the specialisation level of the child archetype.
VSONCO=DE_Specialised archetype object node occurrences conformance: the occurrences of a redefined object node in a specialised archetype must conform to the occurrences in the corresponding node in the flat parent archetype by either being identical, or being wholly contained by the latter.
VSSM=DE_Specialised archetype sibling marker validity: the sibling code used in a sibling marker in a specialised archetype must refer to a node found within the same container in the flat parent archetype.
VOBAV=DE_Object node assumed value validity: the value of an assumed value must fall within the value space defined by the constraint to which it is attached.
VCATU=DE_Attribute uniqueness: sibling attributes occurring within an object node must be uniquely named with respect to each other, in the same way as for class definitions in an object reference model.
VDFAI=DE_Archetype identifier validity in definition. Any archetype identifier mentioned in an archetype slot in the definition section must conform to the published openEHR specification for archetype identifiers.
VUNT=DE_Use_node type validity: the type mentioned in a use_node statement must be the same as or a super-type (according to the reference model) of the reference model type of the node referred to.
VUNP=DE_Use_node path validity: the path mentioned in a use_node statement must refer to an object node defined elsewhere in the same archetype or any of its specialisation parent archetypes, that is not itself an internal reference node, and which carries a node identifier if one is needed at the reference point.
VSCNR=DE_Placeholder constraint node conformance: a placeholder node can only be defined into a reference model type conformant with the type of the original constraint in the parent archetype.
VOTC=DE_openEHR terminology code validity. The code must be defined in the published openEHR terminology. 
VDSCR=DE_Null, empty or unknown mandatory description item such as purpose, original_author or lifecycle.
VSONT=DE_The dynamic types of the node in the specialised archetype and the corresponding node in the parent archetype are not equal (e.g. one is an ConstraintRef and one is a CComplexObject.)
WOUC=DE_Unused Code Warning: A code is defined in the ontology section of the archetype, but is not used in the archetype definition.
WITB=DE_Warning: The path/code referenced in the term binding does not exist in the archetype.
WACMC=DE_Cardinality/occurrences validity warning: where occurrences and cardinality are stated, the interval represented by: (sum of all occurrences minimum values) .. (sum of all occurrences maximum values) must intersect with the interval stated by the cardinality. This is fulfilled, but none of the optional elements could ever be added, because the mandatory elements are already taking up all the space within the container as defined by its cardinality.
ICARM=DE_Info: A commonly constrained functional property has been constrained. 
VOKU=DE_dADL object key must be unique, for example a code in the ontology is present more than once for a language.
