DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF THE REPOSITORY
		This repository is structured using the top-level structure defined at
		http://www.openehr.org/developer/d_svn_um_dir_struct.htm. Due to java's 
		needs, directory structures beneath the top level are fairly typical of
		recommended java structures.

BUILD
        The build script requires JDK and Maven to run. It has been tested with
        J2SDK 1.5.0 and Maven 1.0.2 on both Linux and Windows. It should work
        on other platforms with Java support as well.

        See install.txt for detailed installation instruction.
