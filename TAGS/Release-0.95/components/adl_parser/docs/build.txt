Installation
============
You need to have j2sdk1.5 and Maven 1.0 to be able to build the parser from
source code. If your build machine is online, Maven can download relevant
libraries (see project.xml for dependencies). Otherwise, you will need to
download them manually and put it in your local Maven repository. You also need
to solve the dependency towards the openEHR java kernel.


Build
=====
Type "maven javacc test" to compile and test the code.

Type "maven javacc jar:install" to install the parser jar file into local Maven
repository, but you can also find it under "target".

Type "maven javacc javadoc" to generate java API docs under "target/docs".
