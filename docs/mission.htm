		<h2>Purpose</h2> The purpose of this document is to state the missions
			of the Java Reference Implementation Project for people to 
			understand what the Java project is aiming for and what it can
			provide.
		<br/>
				
		<h2>Missions</h2>
		
		<h4>Validate design specifications</h4>		
		Validate published design specifications through implementation 
		activities and provide concrete feedbacks that will hopefully
		lead to improvement of the specifications.
		
		<h4>Provide a reference Java implementation</h4>		
		Create an implementation in Java that is both faithful to the 
		design specifications and technically sound thus provide 
		educational purpose towards prospective openEHR developers.
  		
		<h4>Explore implementation strategies</h4>			
		Explore different implementation strategies and try to find
		most optimal solutions for given deployment requirement.

		<h4>Provide reusable components</h4>		
		Provide common code base grouped as coherent, reusable 
		software components as building blocks for full-fledged EHR 
		systems.
