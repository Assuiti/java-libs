/**
 * Measurement Package <br />
 *
 * This package defines a minimum of semantics relating to quantitative measurement, units, and conversion, enabling
 * the Quantity package of the <I>open</I>EHR Data Types Information Model to be correctly expressed. As for the Terminology Package,
 * a simple interface is assumed, which provides useful functions to other parts of the reference model.
