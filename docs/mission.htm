			<li>Create an implementation in Java that is both faithful to the 
				design specifications and technically sound thus provide 
				educational purpose towards prospective openEHR developers.</li>	
			<li>Explore different implementation strategies and try to find
				most optimal solutions for given deployment requirement.</li>
